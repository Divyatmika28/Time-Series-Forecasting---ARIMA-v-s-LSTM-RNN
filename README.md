# Time-Series-Forecasting---ARIMA-v-s-LSTM-RNN
Sales Forecasting using ARIMA modeling vs LSTM-RNN

Two forecasting techniques are explored LSTM - RNN & SARIMA. 

The hyperparameters are auto-tuned using gridsearchCV in case of LSTM & for loops in case of SARIMA.

# ARIMA model for time series forecasting.
